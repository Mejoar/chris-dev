EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER
============================
Timestamp: 2025-07-25 16:47:04 UTC
Reason: Force Vercel to redeploy with production API URLs
Status: LOCALHOST ERRORS MUST BE FIXED

This file exists solely to trigger a Vercel deployment.
All frontend API calls MUST use: https://chris-dev-backend.onrender.com
NO localhost:8000 calls should exist in production.

If you still see localhost errors after this deployment,
there is a serious configuration issue with Vercel.
